Solve the MatrixChain problem
if the Matrix Chain is (A1,A2,A3,A4,A5),then we can use
five way to add the parenthesis as follow:
(A1(A2(A3A4))),
(A1((A2A3)A4)),
((A1A2)(A3A4)),
((A1(A2A3))A4),
(((A1A2)A3)A4)

each sequence can have a great effect on the cost of calculate the answer
so we have to use an algorithm to solve this proble which based on the 
Dynamic Programming
